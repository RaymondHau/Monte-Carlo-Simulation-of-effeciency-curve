# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-of-effeciency-curve
Generating an effeciency curve based on data with a given geometry for HPGe Spectroscopy

This python script is used in a HPGe spectroscopy project, to simulate a calibration curve that consideres diffrent geometries
the "Calibration sample Monty python simulation" is used to find the absorbtion-coificient curve to each energy, and is used with a cylindrical sample being placed on top of the detector
the "beaker Monty python simulation" is using the dimensions of a custom made marinelli beaker, and is using the curve from "Calibration sample Monty python simulation" to find the effeciency curve with the custom beaker.
